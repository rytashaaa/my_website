                A Citizen of Nowhere 

In the seemingly never-ending age of social media, a new trend has emerged: global citizenship. It is the perfect fad for a Gen-Z'er (and even Millenials) who sees the world as one without borders. Priyanka Chopra-Jonas, an Indian-American actor, infamously described herself as 'a citizen of the world'. Of course, she was mercilessly trolled for it, but the criticism seemed reserved more for her poor rendition of the American accent and less for her words. She's not the first celebrity to identify herself as a global citizen, and indeed, won't be the last and one can see why; there's a certain charm to it. <br><br>

So, what does it mean to be a global citizen? Well, the term is somewhat open-ended. According to Wikipedia, a global citizen is a person whose identity transcends geographical or political borders and whose memberships and rights are derived from a broader class:" humanity." In theory, this seems to be the perfect answer for global problems such as war, poverty, hunger, and diminishing access to health care. In practice, things become complicated. <br><br>

However, before we begin dissecting the claims of the so-called 'global citizens', it is imperative to discuss the concept of a 'nation' and what being a citizen entails. Yuval Noah Harari states in his book "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" that the nation-state is a concept evoked through wide-scale imagination, and this precise widespread conviction gives political parties their power and people a sense of national pride. It makes sense. Borders in the modern 21st century are arbitrary lines drawn by the winning team. Take India as an example: The Indo-Pakistan border was decided by one Mr. Cyril Radcliffe, and it is still unclear why he chose the division in the way he did. After all, ethnically, Pakistanis and Indians are the same, and pre-1947, both countries were a healthy amalgamation of various religions. This then begs the question: what makes a person a citizen of a country? Is it their physical appearance? Their religious identity? The origin of their passport? Of course, the latter is the most popular answer to the question. But like most things in the area of geopolitical and social geography, nothing is quite so simple.<br><br>

Let us use Ireland as an example. What sort of person comes to mind when asked to picture an average Irish citizen (racial stereotypes notwithstanding)? Is it someone with darker skin and hair? Or someone of Chinese descent? The answer is probably no, even though the reality is that a person with the aforementioned features can most certainly hold an Irish passport, and thus, by popular definition, be an Irish citizen. It goes without saying then that generalising the concept of citizenship for a population is challenging work and something I won't do in this article. However, I will say that if one identifies with a country's culture and relates to its people's shared experiences, then one can say with fair confidence that they are a member of the mentioned nation. <br><br>

Now, let's address the elephant in the room (and why you're probably still reading this article): global citizenship. As mentioned before, the theory is sound, but the practice is flimsy. In fact, I propose that 'global citizens' can be generalised into two broad categories: 'The Snobs' and 'The Escape Artists'. <br><br>

Let's start with The Snobs. These are a group of people who have more than two stamps on their passports; they've partied in Italy, surfed in Australia, and probably helped an orphan in Rwanda. Now, the last part is what really cements their self-identification as a citizen of the world. After all, what good is it being a part of the human collective and travelling to a bunch of countries, if you haven't made some charitable pit-stops along the way, right? <br><br>

Mrs. Chopra-Jonas falls right into this category. <br><br>

Somehow, The Snobs believe that their extensive travel record rids them of any responsibility to a singular nation. Of course, they often ignore that the country whose passport they carry and the physical features they wear has its own problems. If they feel obligated to clean up the mess of the world, shouldn't they make their beds first? Apparently not, because any sense of national responsibility is seen as secondary to the duties of the 'humanity' collective. Now, I would understand this sentiment if identifying as a part of a quasi-moralistic group was yielding some positive results on the global stage. But as it turns out, the world is exactly where it was before it had these people trying to join 'the global citizen intiative'. The truth is that The Snobs can evade their national obligations all they want and still hold the rights and privileges as members of a nation. They can vote, take out loans, buy properties, and all that jazz that comes with owning a specific passport. Helping out orphans in desolate African countries is at the forefront of their minds only until their actual citizenship poses no issues in their life. Convenient, is it not? <br><br>

Now, if you recall, in some previous paragraphs, I highlighted my take on the classification of a citizen and said that one could be a citizen of a country if one relates to the culture and experiences of the members of said country. So, in all fairness, shouldn't The Snobs, with their many passport stamps, be considered citizens of all the countries they've visited and enjoyed the culture of? <br><br>

No. <br><br>

At the very least, being a nation's citizen consists of holding a passport. At most, it means being part of a shared recollection of the nation's triumphs and defeats. It does not mean staying in hotels and enjoying only the good parts of a country. An admirable travel record is good; it teaches you about life, how to navigate difficult situations, and how to be part of a much larger tribe. But to think that it gives you the right to denounce your place in a national community and instead solely identify with a global one is rather ignorant. One can very well identify as a member of a nation and also as a global citizen simultaneously, as long as they realise that their first responsibility is their nation and then, the world. <br><br>

Now, let's talk about The Escape Artists. These individuals have a rather large bone to pick with their countries. So big, in fact, that they've decided they would rather identify as citizens of no country than identity as belonging to their country. Most of the time, The Escape Artists are first-generation immigrants that have left their home nation in favour of greener pastures elsewhere. At first, they may look upon their motherland with fond memories, and state that they left the joy in life back' home'. That is, until they decide to go back 'home' and realise that this is no longer the country they grew up in. Suddenly, their brain highlights every bad part of the country tenfold as some form of reparation for their false expectations. To clarify: these are not people that have faced war, strife, or famine in their motherlands. The Escape Artists are ordinary middle-class people from countries like India and China that bought into the Western World Dream. Now, these people stand at crossroads: unable to identify as citizens of their current nation and unwilling to let go of their memories and expectations of their birth nation. So, what do they do? They identify as global citizens, of course! <br><br>

There's a very special sect of The Escape Artists made up of individuals living in their birth country and yet choosing to identify with the global state first. There are plenty of them in India. While their more generic counterparts - the first-generation immigrants- are comprised of (mostly) of the older generation, this particular group is young blood. <br><br>

Let's use India as an example again.<br><br>

The rise of the Modi government and their Hindu-favouring policies saw unrest between communities, particularly the Hindus and Muslims. Now, the Gen-Z'ers and Millenials saw this as a perfect opportunity for their virtue signalling tactics and began a mass denunciation of their identities as Indians. Did they read the policies? No. Did they read the constitution? No. Did they bother to read the history of these communities in India? No. But it doesn't matter! Everything is forgiven if one takes to Instagram and writes lengthy paragraphs condemning the country's current state. However, here's food for thought: one's 'Indian(ess)' doesn't fluctuate with governments and their policies. One can't choose to identify or not identify themselves as being members of a nation-state, depending on their mood. Sure, condemning policies is okay, excellent even (the Indian constitution places high value on freedom of speech), but saying that you're no longer Indian is not solving the problem. Heck, it's not even acknowledging any problem. Instead, one is very much allowed to be disappointed in the state of their country but still be a part of it. <br><br>

There you have it, folks; my piece on the global citizen trend. Clearly, I feel rather strongly about it, but this comes from almost a lifetime of not knowing what nation to pledge allegiance to until recent years. The truth is, I was one of those global citizenship believers because I thought it would help me solidify my identity. Alas, I quickly realised that the human identity couldn't be inflated to fit a vast category without first being shaped to be a part of smaller ones. If this was not the case, why stop being just global citizens? Why not citizens of the Universe? After all, I'm sure there's some alien planet out there that could use our charity. <br><br>
