                They know. The Americans know! They’ve figured out our secret before we could even hope to decipher it ourselves. And boy, are they wielding it against us. <br><br>
                
                The Americans did what previous Indian governments can only hope to do because for once, Indian news channels are all gushing about the same thing:  <br><br>
                
                Unescorted  <br><br>
                
                Access  <br><br>
                
                To the <br><br>
                
                Drumroll please. <br><br>
                
                PENTAGON!!! <br><br>
                
                Yes, you read that correctly. Indian’s defence attache is now privy to the Pentagon’s deepest, darkest secrets without a babysitter. Of course, it is another matter entirely that these ’deepest, darkest secrets’ we can now access are just the corridors of the building (and maybe a tour of the lush gardens - unescorted, of course).  <br><br>
                
                You see, us Indians love our protocols. We love following the rules and oh lord, we don’t just believe in the hierarchy system, we revere it. So, when a nation like the United States comes along and tells us “By the way, we’re willing to forego protocol just for you”, we start salivating. We forget that this is the same country that funds ISI operations in Kashmir and that this is the same country that sanctioned us for rightfully testing our nukes. Because now, this is America, and America is our friend.  <br><br>
                
                The Americans, of course, realised this a long time ago. The Indian appetite for following rules and obeying protocols is insatiable. So, what better way to give India a false sense of security other than showing us that we’re special enough for rules to be broken for.  <br><br>
                
                Here’s the thing: this unescorted business in the Pentagon is merely by name. There is no real camaraderie here because India still doesn’t have access to the Americans’ military technology, strategic alliances, and most probably, a meeting room in the Pentagon that isn’t tapped. Will we ever get this? Most likely no. But damn, will the Americans will try their hardest to make us believe we have the next best thing: no babysitters.  <br><br>
