In 1974, when India tested its first Nuclear bomb in Pokhran, Rajasthan, it was condemned and sanctioned by various countries such as the United States. For a good reason (at least in their eyes) because any country that is a nuclear power is one less than the number of countries The United States can bully into submission. Of course, because this is THE UNITED STATES we’re talking about, they have other ways to get around such dilemmas (NATO, anybody?). The point is that one can pick a relatively small fight with a nuclear power, but one can never let it develop into a full-blown war. <br><br>

Now, let’s take Indo-China relations as an example. It is a poorly covered secret that India is the West’s defence against China in Asia. For one, we’re the only country with a military big enough to take them (Russia, of course, does not count), and two, we have our bones to pick with them. <br><br>

Disclaimer: when I say the ‘West’, I mean The United States of America, mainly because most everything in the actual West is under their hegemony. <br><br>

Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan most likely kicked off a series of events leading to India being stuck dealing with our ‘oh-so-friendly’ neighbours yet again. One might ask why this visit was somehow special when US officials have been visiting Taiwan for years now. You see, geopolitics is all a waiting game. Whoever can wait for the longest and seem the least threatening while doing so will eventually come out on top, which is exactly what China has done. They played the waiting game - bidding their time and saying nothing when faced with Western micro-humiliations. But now, they’ve risen enough and gained enough power on the global stage to be able to at least bark back. Bark, not bite. Of course, The United States is still the global superpower and sent Ms. Pelosi on an official visit to Taiwan whilst seemingly ignoring China’s empty threats for doing so. It goes without saying then that this was a mortifying event in Mr. Xi Jin Ping’s history as the leader of The Communist Party and most likely weakened his hold over the next ‘elections’. So, what would be the best way to raise his fallen honour off the ground? A border skirmish with India, of course! To regain his reputation in the eyes of his colleagues at The Party, biting a chunk out of India would be the best route for Xi Jin Ping. <br><br>

Anyways, I digress. The point is, there’s a real chance China may start a small-scale conflict with India, whether now or in the near future. But the more significant point is that no one will come to help India. Not America, not Russia - which will likely remain neutral-and certainly not any other members of The Quad. So, what guarantee do we Indians have that China won’t just claim a considerable piece of our country? <br><br>

Our nukes, people, our nukes! <br><br>

This is the biggest advantage of being a nuclear power; no other country will mess with you too much. In the off-chance our army isn’t able to deter the Chinese, our nukes certainly will. When it comes to war time, the losing side is more than ready to sacrifice themselves to harm the opponent. So, China may decide to bite a morsel out of India (if even that), but they certainly won’t take a huge bite. <br><br>

The opposite is true for countries like Ukraine, which signed away its opportunity to obtain nuclear weapons in 1994. Perhaps if this was not the case, Russia might have never dared to venture so deep into Ukrainian territory and for so long. Of course, I admit this is a wholly simplistic view of conflicts, and there is much more at play here than nuclear weapons. In fact, the Russian-Ukraine conflict would have to be explained in its post -which I may do- for all sides to be covered. But for all intents and purposes, the direction of the conflict can be boiled down to only one side having nuclear weapons. <br><br>

You may be thinking at this time that a nuclear war is inevitable, and it’s only a moment before a cornered country pushes the metaphorical red button and blows the whole world up. Fortunately, this won’t be the case (never say never, though). A deterrent doesn’t have to be used for it to be a threat. China knows very well that India won’t wage nuclear war against them and cause an extinction event, but the real danger isn’t the weapon; it is the ‘what if.’ What if China pushes too far and India realises mutual destruction is better than being destroyed alone? Realistically, this won’t happen. But China, and any other country, don’t want to take chances. Why is it that the United States pushes and prods at no-nuke countries with little control but won’t do the same for Russia, which has been a sworn enemy since the mid-20th century? <br><br>
